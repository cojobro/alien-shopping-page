Challenge: Alien Shopping Page

Objective: Build a shopping webpage that showcases a list of products with a search bar
and sorting options. Implementing these features will give you hands-on experience with
JavaScript for handling user interactions and manipulating content dynamically.
Instructions

1. Create a Product Page:
○ Design a main "Product" page where each product is displayed as a card.
○ Each product card should include:
■ Product Name
■ Image
■ Price
■ Category (e.g., "Electronics," "Clothing")


2. Search Functionality:
○ Add a search bar at the top of the page that allows users to search for
products by name.
○ Implement JavaScript to filter the products as the user types in the search
bar, displaying only products that match the search term.

3. Sorting Options:
○ Add sorting options (e.g., a dropdown menu) to sort the products by:
■ Price (Low to High, High to Low)
■ Name (A-Z, Z-A)
○ Use JavaScript to dynamically sort the product list based on the selected
option.

4. Additional Features (Optional):
○ Category Filter: Add checkboxes or a dropdown to filter products by
category.
○ Highlighting Matches: When searching, highlight matching text in the
product names for easier visibility.

5. Styling:
○ Use CSS to style the product gallery, search bar, and sorting options.
○ Make sure the layout is clean and intuitive, with clear visual separation
between products.

6. Deployment on GitHub Pages:
○ Deploy your shopping webpage to GitHub Pages by pushing your code to a
GitHub repository and configuring GitHub Pages.
